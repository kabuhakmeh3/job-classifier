**Motivation**

Job boards have millions of postings. 
Job search sites are paid by link clicks.
Postings for skilled positions receive low conversion rates in when shown to an
advertising audience from social media platforms.
Featuing less-skilled positions results in lower ad-spend and higher return.
Identifying whether a job is low or high skilled is desireable.
Specific focus given to gig-economy jobs.
